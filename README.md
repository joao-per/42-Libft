## 🗣️ About

I created a library with some basic functions that will help me save a lot of time and space in my future works. 
Every function and it's details are [**here**](https://github.com/joao-per/Libft/blob/main/en.subject.pdf).

## 🛠️ Download

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

```shell
git clone https://github.com/joao-per/Libft.git
```
